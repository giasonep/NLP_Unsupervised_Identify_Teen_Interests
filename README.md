# NLP to Identify Teen Interests
Metis NLP Unsupervised Module 5 Project

## ABSTRACT

For this project, I used Python Package Indexâ€™s `youtube_transcript_api` to collect the transcript data from over one thousand YouTube videos targeted to the teenage demographic in order to better understand teenage interests, as well as word and phrase usage. To do this, I used natural language processing techniques such as text preprocessing with `NLTK`, dimensionality reduction with `Non-Negative Matrix Factorization`, and sentiment analysis with `TextBlob`. I was able to extract fifteen unique topics from the dataset, uncovered a handful of formerly unfamiliar words/YouTube celebrities to me, and exposed interests and YouTube subcultures of which I was not previously aware.
